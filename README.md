# Ready-to-use-Edge-Detection-using-BDCN
This repository provides an inference script for the Bi-Directional Cascade Network (BDCN) for perceptual edge detection, designed to simplify the inference process.

## Script Overview

The script includes the following main functions:

- ```init_edge_detection_model(checkpoint_path, rate): Initializes the edge detection model.```
- ```convert_to_black_edges(edge_image_path): Converts white-edged images to black-edged images.```
- ```detect_edges(model, test_image_path, output_dir): Performs edge detection on the input image and saves the output.```
